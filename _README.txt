If the player drone or enemy drones are moving too fast or too slow, edit acceleration.txt inside the Settings folder.
(Ex: Controls too sensitive and moving fast -> change 9.8 to 4.2, etc.)

If you'd like to play with a controller, type 'Y' inside controller.txt, if not, type 'n'. You need to run DS4Windows.exe first if you wish to use a controller. Use the left joystick to move, right joystick to aim and R2 to shoot.

Before starting BattleAtDawn.exe, start DirectX_window.exe and DS4Windows.exe if you're using a controller. Else, use the WASD keys to move and 'O' to shoot.

Enjoy!
